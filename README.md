# An Undertale Battle Simulator

What can I say? It's Undertale, but it's on the web! This is a battle simulator which aims to include every battle in Undertale, playable on desktop, mobile, maybe your smart fridge, whatever can get its hands on the Internet.

## Features
* A faithful recreation of the battle system
  * Every enemy, every bullet pattern, and every boss
* An on screen HUD which includes mobile controls
* A "Story Mode" which allows you to fight all enemies in order
  * Your progress along it is saved
  * Your actions affect what enemies you will fight
  * Encounters can be skipped
* New QOL features, such as a Mercy meter, and allowing you to spare everyone at once

## Roadmap:
* Finish the Engine (In Progress)
* Code every ingame battle
* Add support for custom battles via specialized JSON files (for security purposes)
