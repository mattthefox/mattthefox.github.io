What can I say? It's Undertale, but it's on the web! This is a battle simulator which aims to include every battle in Undertale, playable on the web.

Roadmap:
Finish the Engine. (In Progress)
Code every ingame battle.
Add support for custom battles, likely via JSON files for security. (Don't want a fanmade Papyrus to inject a payload into your computer, after all.)
