# An Undertale Battle Simulator

What can I say? It's Undertale, but it's on the web! This is a battle simulator which aims to include every battle in Undertale, playable on desktop, mobile, maybe your smart fridge, whatever can get its hands on the Internet.

## Features
* A faithful recreation of the game
* An on screen HUD which includes mobile controls.
* A "Story Mode" which allows you to fight all enemies in order, with your progress being saved!
* New QOL features, such as a Mercy meter, and allowing you to spare everyone at once.



Roadmap:
Finish the Engine. (In Progress)
Code every ingame battle.
Add support for custom battles, likely via JSON files for security. (Don't want a fanmade Papyrus to inject a payload into your computer, after all.)
